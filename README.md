A form validator build with the help of HTML/CSS and JAVASCRIPT. Whenever the user tries to submit the form without filling the mentioned details or by filling wrong details, a message pops up below the wrongly entered input field stating the user to fill the input field correctly. WHenever the form is submitted, it calls the validate function which handles all the functions of checking the input fields.
